    <h1>PV Sindhu</h1>
    <p>
        P.V. Sindhu (born July 5, 1995, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh state [now in Telangana state], India) is a professional badminton player from India who has made her mark in the 21st century with a number of wins at the Commonwealth Games, the Badminton World Federation (BWF) Championships, and the Olympic Games. She is the first Indian woman to win two Olympic medals—a silver medal at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games and a bronze at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games (held in 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic)—in addition to being the first Indian woman to win a gold medal at the BWF Championships (2019). She has received some of the highest sporting honors and civilian awards in India, including the Padma Shri (2015), the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award (2016; the honor was later renamed to Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award), and the Padma Bhushan (2020). She ranked number 16 on Forbes magazine’s list of highest-paid female athletes in 2023.

Early life
Sindhu is the younger of two daughters born to P.V. Ramana and P. Vijaya, both national-level volleyball players. While growing up, she often accompanied her parents to their South Central Railway volleyball teams’ practices and matches; however, she never took an interest in playing the sport. When Sindhu was six years old, badminton caught her attention when she saw legendary player Pullela Gopichand win the 2001 All England Open Badminton Championships. Her father signed her up for training at the Mahboob Ali Badminton Academy when she was eight. She then went on to train with S.M. Arif, former chief national badminton coach, at the Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium, Hyderabad, and eventually with Gopichand at the Pullela Gopichand Badminton Academy in Hyderabad.

Sindhu and her father traveled 30 km (19 miles) each way twice a day so she could train at Gopichand’s academy, and working with him paid off for the young athlete. She won the all-India ranking tournament in the under-10 singles category and later in the under-13 doubles category. She won the gold medal in the under-14 category at the 51st National School Games of India.

In 2009 Sindhu made her international debut at the Sub-Junior Asian Badminton Championships and took home a bronze medal. At the India Open the same year, she made her senior debut although she was still playing at the junior level then. In 2010 she was a runner-up at the Iran Fajr International Challenge and a quarterfinalist at the Junior World Badminton Championships in Mexico.

A standout moment of Sindhu’s career came at the Rio 2016 Olympics when she became the youngest (at age 21) and first Indian woman to win a silver medal. For her efforts in Rio, she was honored with the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award, India’s highest sporting honor. She followed that up by winning her first Super Series title at the China Open in November of that year and then went on to win three more Super Series titles: the India Open in April 2017, the Korea Open in September 2017, and the BWF World Tour Finals in December 2018, a first for an Indian athlete.

At the 2018 Commonwealth Games, Sindhu took the silver in women’s singles and the gold in the mixed team event. That same year Sindhu won the silver medal at the Asian Games and the BWF World Championships. The following year she won the gold medal at the 2019 BWF World Championships, making her the first Indian woman to win the gold and the most successful Indian ever at the championships, having earned a total of five medals by 2019: one gold (2019), two silver (2017 and 2018), and two bronze (2013 and 2014). In recognition of Sindhu’s achievements, the Indian government awarded her the prestigious Padma Bhushan for 2020.
In 2021 Sindhu won the bronze medal at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, making her the first Indian woman to win two Olympic medals. She went on to take the bronze medal at the Badminton Asia Championships in 2022 and followed that up with her first Commonwealth Games gold medal, despite suffering a stress fracture to her left ankle during play.

Sindhu’s injury meant that she wasn’t in top form in 2023, but she managed to secure India’s first medal, a bronze, at the Badminton Asia Mixed Team Championships in February that year. In October of the same year, Sindhu had to withdraw from the French Open Super 750 after sustaining a knee injury, which sidelined her from tournament play for four months. She returned to competition in March 2024 at the French Open Super 750 but was eliminated in the quarterfinals.

Sindhu is training in Bengaluru, India, with Indonesian coach Agus Dwi Santoso in her bid to secure a spot at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games and fulfill her dream of winning an Olympic gold medal. Although the list of Indian badminton players who have qualified for the Paris Olympics will be officially released on April 30, Sindhu has won a quota for women’s singles and is predicted to safely make the cut when the official list is released.
Badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.

Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 meters) long and 17 feet (5.2 meters) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 meters) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 meters) high stretches across the width of the court at its center. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 meters) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches.
A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.
